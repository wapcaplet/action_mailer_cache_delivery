ActionMailerCacheDelivery
========================

Currently ActionMailer only supports :test, :smtp & :sendmail delivery methods.
This plugin enhances ActionMailer to support the :cache method, which behaves like
:test, except that the deliveries are marshalled to a temporary cache file, thus,
making them available to other processes.


About this fork
===============

This fork includes enhancements from a couple other forks. It includes an
enhancement from liangzan's fork to support email_spec compatibility:

    http://github.com/liangzan/action_mailer_cache_delivery

as well as couple additions from grimsock's fork to return an empty list
whenever the cache file is nonexistent or empty, and to only load this module
when the environment is 'cucumber' or 'selenium':

    http://github.com/grimsock/action_mailer_cache_delivery

None of the existing forks of this project appear to handle the case where the
tmp/cache directory doesn't exist. This results in failures when trying to read
or write the cache file. This fork remedies that.


Installation
============

  #$ cd RAILS_ROOT
  #$ ./script/plugin install git://github.com/wapcaplet/action_mailer_cache_delivery.git


Example
=======

In your RAILS_ROOT/config/environments/test.rb, make sure you have the line:

  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :cache

And that's all. To access the cached deliveries in another process, just do:

  ActionMailer::Base.cached_deliveries # array of TMail::Mail instances
